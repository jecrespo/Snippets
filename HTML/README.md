javascript_get.html:
This is a simple webpage example to communicate with an Arduino via a get http request with javascript.
With this example you can choose the Arduino IP and send the state of two relays for changing the relays state. Also, the Arduino response is shown in the html iframe.

Now you have to write the Arduino code to read the http get request and the relays values for changing the state. Furthermore write the response to the request with a html webpage containing the state of the Arduino inputs or just an acknowledge.
